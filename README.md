Structure <a name="structure"></a>
The HTML file (index.html) is structured with standard HTML5 elements. It includes a navigation bar, a banner, the main content section, and a sharing section. The stylesheet (style.css) provides the necessary styling for a clean and visually appealing design.

Styles <a name="styles"></a>
The stylesheet (style.css) defines the overall look and feel of the website. It includes styles for the body, navigation bar, banner, main content, headings, paragraphs, pull-quotes, byline, and the sharing section.

Navigation <a name="navigation"></a>
The navigation bar is designed with an unordered list (<ul>) containing list items (<li>) for different news categories. The logo is styled differently to stand out. The navigation bar is horizontally centered with text-align, and each item has a padding and letter-spacing for spacing and style.

Banner <a name="banner"></a>
The banner section includes an image and a headline. The background image is set to cover the entire banner section. The headline is enclosed in a bordered box for emphasis.

Main Content <a name="main-content"></a>
The main content section contains an article headline, byline, paragraphs, and a pull-quote. The text is styled for readability, with different font sizes, colors, and line heights. The pull-quote has a distinctive style to highlight a key statement.

Sharing Section <a name="sharing-section"></a>
The sharing section provides links for sharing the article on social media. The links have a red background with white text and change appearance on hover to encourage user interaction.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. For any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation or contact the developer.
