## Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The `index.html` file is structured with standard HTML5 elements. It includes a navigation bar, a banner, the main content section, and a sharing section. The stylesheet, `style.css`, provides the necessary styling for a clean and visually appealing design.

## Styles <a name="styles"></a>

The `style.css` file defines the overall look and feel of the website. It includes styles for the body, navigation bar, banner, main content, headings, paragraphs, pull-quotes, byline, and the sharing section.

## Navigation <a name="navigation"></a>

The navigation bar is designed with an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing list items (`<li>`) for different news categories. The logo is styled differently to stand out. The navigation bar is horizontally centered with text-align, and each item has padding and letter-spacing for spacing and style.

## Banner <a name="banner"></a>

The banner section includes an image and a headline. The background image is set to cover the entire banner section. The headline is enclosed in a bordered box for emphasis.

## Main Content <a name="main-content"></a>

The main content section contains an article headline, byline, paragraphs, and a pull-quote. The text is styled for readability, with different font sizes, colors, and line heights. The pull-quote has a distinctive style to highlight a key statement.

## Sharing Section <a name="sharing-section"></a>

The sharing section provides links for sharing the article on social media. The links have a red background with white text and change appearance on hover to encourage user interaction.
